# Ideas:
- CQRS implementation. There was no need to implement it now due to small scale 
- Users / Authentication / Authorisations -> jwt / oauth2 / mfa 
- More endpoints for portfolios 
- More endpoints for stocks
- More filters, e.g.
	- By value
	- By creation date
	- Get deleted
	- etc.
- Validators 
- List paginations
- Transactions between portfolios/users 
- Multiple portfolios for one user
- History for currencies
- Transaction history
- Analysis of transactions, stocks, portfolios
	- by date - how many transactions
	- by currency
	- by profit based on currency history
- Integration with a service providing actual stock share prices
- more unit/integration tests
- notifications 
- Background jobs that buy/sell shares with our requirements that we have set up
- Description of endpoints in the swagger
